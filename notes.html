<h1>Developer Notes</h1>
<div>
The map is currently working and most of my dat sets are loaded in but not actually doing anything. Current goal: get the state dat ato be usable via d3. Note: Not all race data is displayed; only white, black, asian, and two or more races data is included in my population data for each state. Additionally, each state's population is of 40 year olds (the average age of computer scientists). This was done because the population data gave every age 0 through 85 and they're race and sex.The changes I made were for simplicity and relevancy's sake.
