# Final-Project
My final project from CSC 160 Web Data & Design.

Below is the rubric for this project:

Web Data Design
Final  Project - Solo Project
Paper Report Due - Dec 5th in class and on paper
Project Due - Dec 5th

Your final project is to create a single data visualization based on your cause.  You project will be graded very harshly so you will want to use the generous amount of time for this project on prototyping, experimenting, and refining.  

The Data: You should utilize a real world data source.  Your data should have at least five dimensions of information that you will directly utilize in your visualization.

The Visualization:  You should visually communicate a message from the data that is clear and illuminating.  While all will require titles, labels, and legends to work, you should minimize large blocks of test to understand your visualization.  Users should interact with your data in an intuitive fashion and be able to access information in a straightforward way.

Unique:  Your visualization should be unique.  You may not create a data visualization that you have already seen.  (I had a student argue that he did not deserve a low grade because he had copied a professional visualization to submit for his assignment.  He had gotten a low grade because he only had 3 dimensions of data.  However, given that he admitted to copying his visualization, his grade then got lower.) You may draw inspiration from unrelated data visualizations, but these must show up in your writeup.  Anyone found "borrowing" a visualization of their dataset, even for "inspiration" will receive a 0 for the final project.

Beautiful: Your visualization should be well crafted, pleasant to look at and make good use of color, shape, and connectedness to show relationships.  Animations should help guide the user's eye to understand the shift in the data relationships.

D3:  You must use D3 to generate your visualizations.  It must be something that you could not create with excel.  Many of you will need to use more complex layouts or maps to complete your project.  Many more will end up creating something that never existed.  If you find that you need a specialized library other than d3 contact the instructor for permission prior to use. You probably do not need it to make a case for your cause unless it is a layout library.








Notes for success: 

Start early

Get very familiar with your data.  Some data sets have nothing interesting to talk about, others require a lot of work to find something that is interesting.  If you start early you can come to a good set of data to interact with.

Always do sketches of what you want before actually programming it.  Excel is a great program to get a feel for your data.  You'll save days of work by tweaking things with a pencil rather than coding it each time.

You will want to test your program against real people.  If the visualization is not intuitive to others, it needs more work.




Paper  Your paper should describe your design and implementation is due Dec 5th.  It should be handed in on paper and submitted electronically.  It should clearly detail 
0) What is your cause and why is it important to you.
1) The URL to your project as well as the URL of the repository.
2) Where your datasets are from and what is represented in your datasets (multiple datasets are encouraged if your topic needs it.  I.E. weather data to run alongside data about boating accidents).
3) What surprising thing have you uncovered/shown in your visualization.  An answer of "they can look at the data" is not sufficient.
4) Why is your design well suited to present your findings.  You should link back to what you have learned from class as well as your reading from Cario.
5) What are the pieces that make your work complex.  It will be very easy for me to overlook that if I don't have it in front of me.
6) Provide page number references or web links to any influences to your visualization.
7) An evaluation of your project using the rubric listed below.  Please copy and paste the rubric and select the appropriate slots.  I will apply a penalty to any submissions that drastically over evaluate their work.

There is no page limit for your paper, but excluding any static images and the rubric, I would have a hard time imagining anyone having more than 2 pages of text to detail all of this information.





Website
You should have a final draft of your project on 3rd as well.  You will seek out feedback from your peers on how to improve it and possibly help in detecting bugs or inaccuracies.  You will present your final project on 5th.



Grading - notice there is more that 100% possible.

Shows truth (only one of these)
5%
Displays information with at least 5 dimensions about a topic
15%
Effectively displays information that is easy to navigate and understand
25%
Makes an effective (and truthful) argument to dispel a myth


Beauty and Engagement (all that apply)
5%
Effective layout and decoration using css
10%
Pleasing interactions, intuitive actions occur due to hovers or clicks
5%
Engaging animation
5%
Animation is central to understanding the data


Embracing the Medium (only one of these)
5%
Static information that can be displayed using a standard spreadsheet.
15%
Leverages interactivity to access all dimensions of data (but may not all at once)
25%
Effectively combines at least 5 dimensions of data in a visualization




Level of Difficulty
(only one of these)
5%
Histogram, pie chart, stacked bar chart  (assumes use of libraries)
15%
Tree, Choropleth, Chord, Tree packing (assumes use of libraries)
20%
Unique visualization or unique addition to an existing visualization




Documentation - (all that apply) as a paper turned in both electronically on the site and in paper form last day of class.
10%
Describes what a user should see, how they interact with it, and how they will interpret it.  Your document should reference relevant ideas from Cairo.  (You may reference chapters not assigned to the class)
5%
Lists Sources of data and rates the authenticity of the sources
5%
Fills out this rubric and evaluates their contributions
-5%
If not turned in, on paper, on due date.


Extra - Be it data collection, complex algorithms, unified field theory, or just soap.  Be sure to talk about it.
??%
If you do not report on this, then it didn't happen.  If you are not sure if it would count as something extra, then go on a report it anyway.
